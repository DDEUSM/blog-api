# Blog API

The Blog API is an Application Programming Interface for blog management in Node.js, based on REST principles such as client-server, statelessness, a layered system, and uniform resources. It also incorporates some clean architecture principles, including the domain layer (entities, business rules), application layer (use cases, some DTOs), and infrastructure layer (adapters, repositories, routes, and some contracts).
